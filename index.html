    This website aims to shed light on some of these demographics, exploring how various regions, ethnicities, and ages have been impoverished over the years through various graphs.

<p>This chloropleth displays the percentage of poverty by state over the years during COVID. As shown, practically every state's poverty rate increased, some more dramatically than others.
    By 2021, some had relatively recovered, though not back to their pre-COVID rates. Others, such as New Mexico and Arkansas, only continued to see their rates increase.
    Strangely, states like Mississippi decreased in poverty levels over the three years.

    This pie chart describes the number of people in poverty by ethnicity. So, as shown by the chart, despite making up only 13% of the population, African Americans 
    account for 19.8% of those in poverty, while Whites, despite being 57.8% of the population, barely account for over half of those in poverty. Hispanics, despite being only
    18.7% of the population, account for almost a quarter of those in poverty. Native Americans/Alaskan Natives only comprise of 1.1% of the population yet more than triple that 
    in their poverty rates, while Asians/Pacific Islanders have some of the lowest rates of poverty in the United States.

    This bar graph displays the amount of people in poverty by age group in America over the years. As shown, ever since the 2008 Recession, those 65+ have become more impoverished over all, and have
    not been able to recover since, especially with the recent COVID epidemic. As well, ever since the 1981–1982 recession, those 18-64 have increased from previous rates of 14k or lower to around
    15-20k, spiking during the 2008 Recession to over 25k.

    Again, the rates between those under 18 and those 18-64 are fairly similar, signaling greater rates of poverty in African American communities. African Americans uniquely hold a position where their graph
    is very 'flat' and not increasing overtime as the population increases, as opposed to the other graphs which appear to steadily increase over the decades and go upwards.

    Native Americans/Alaskan Natives show a very sporadic increase in poverty, as well as the signature closeness of under 18 and 18-64 rates for those most impoverished. The biggest spike from any of the graphs 
    during the 2008 Recession can be seen here, showing that the Recession hit Native Americans/Alaskan Natives far harder in comparison to other ethnicities.

    Finally, the Asian populace, with their low poverty rates and overall wealth, show a wide margin between those younger than 18 and those 18-64. Interestingly, their older than 65 rates have been steadily
    increasing and have recently surpassed the steadily decreasing below 18 rates, something unseen by any other ethnicity.

</div><h1>Conclusions</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>Through analyzing poverty in regions, ethnicities, and ages, a lot can be gathered about the disproportions within society as well as how economic recessions have damaged many for decades after their onset.
    The COVID epidemic greatly increased poverty rates for almost every state, producing a level of poverty which has not returned to its pre-COVID rates. While poverty rates have generally decreased over time 
    and thus the general standard of living has increased in the United States, some ethnicities are significantly and disproportionately affected by poverty. Whites and Asians have the lowest poverty rates,
    while Hispanic, Black, and Native American/Alaskan Natives have fairly high and disproportionate rates of poverty, with Native Americans/Alaskan Natives having some of the highest rates in the United States. 
    Those 65 and older are experiencing the highest rates of poverty in decades. Overall poverty rates can be traced back to recessions such as the 1980-1981 recession, as poverty rates have not returned to
    rates before that recession. Through comparing different age groups of various ethnicities, a clear trend can be found in the rates of poverty in those >18 and those 18-64 and how impoverished an ethnicity is.
    <br><br>
    With all of this in view, it is important to note and address the disparities that are clearly present between ethnicities in their rates of poverty. Attention should be brought to the long-lasting 
    implications that economic recessions can have on society. As well, age is an important factor to consider when discussing poverty that might otherwise not be brought up as often.
